# MEM_CostUncertainty

This repository is related to the paper entitled "Implications of Uncertainty in Technology Cost Projections for Least-Cost Decarbonized Electricity Systems", which is now pre-accepted in iScience. 

This repository primarily holds codes for:

(1) Macro Energy Model (MEM) that is used to conduct simulations; 
(2) Postprocess codes used to analyze the model outputs. 

The size of raw model outputs is too large and thus not provided. However, a bunch of mid-step outputs extracted from raw model outputs that are keys datasets for results presented in the paper are provided on Zenodo and can be found here: 10.5281/zenodo.6597930

If you have any questions, please contact Lei Duan (leiduan@carnegiescience.edu) for future information.
